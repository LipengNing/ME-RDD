# ME-RDD
The ME-RDD toolbox provides the algorithms proposed in the paper "Maximum-entropy estimation of joint relaxation-diffusion distribution using multi-TE diffusion MRI" by Lipeng Ning in MICCAI 2023.
The MICCAI-example folder provides the script for the examples.
The papercode_Journal folder contains the methods developed in the journal-version of the paper, including the MaxEnt method for noisy data, the LS+ method and the MUSIC method.
